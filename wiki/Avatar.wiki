== Creating Initial Avatar ==

=== Execution Flow ===

_This section will briefly describe how the process works._

1. *Client*: Trigger creation by registering for an account.

2. *Server*: Creates a default avatar and stores into database.

=== Implementation ===

_This section will describe the execution flow in much greater detail. Each step will reference a specific file as a starting point in which it's describing._

1. *Client-side*:

`>> Register.py | Method: submitText()`

As part of the registration process, RequestRegister will be sent to register for an account and in doing so, the server will automatically create an avatar for the new player.

2. *Server-side*:

`>> RequestRegist.java | Method: doBusiness()`

For new accounts, the server will create a default avatar by creating an entry into the database using the `createAvatar()` method from AvatarDAO. Each avatar will start with an initial amount of gold.

The next time the player logs in, the avatar will be selected by default before joining a world.
