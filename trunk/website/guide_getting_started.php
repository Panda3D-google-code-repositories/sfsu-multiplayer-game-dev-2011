        <h1>Getting Started</h1>
        <div class="container_brown">
            <p>Need help getting started? Look no further! But first, make sure you have latest version of the game, if not, you'll need to head over to the <a href="download_game_client.php">Downloads</a> page and choose the version that best matches your platform. Prepare to wait a while for those who have a slower connection.</p>
            <p>While it's busy downloading, let's get started with a quick overview of the game.</p>
        </div>
        <br />
        <div class="container_brown">
            <p>The name, World of Balance, comes from the idea of creating a balanced ecosystem. And it's exactly that. The game requires you to manage an ecosystem by introducing the appropriate species, purchasable from the Shop, that will help you create a sustainable ecosystem to achieve the highest score as possible.</p>
            <p>Each player starts out with a few organisms in the ecosystem as well as a small amount of gold for purchasing and placing organisms in the ecosystem. As time progresses, the organisms in the ecosystem will eat, reproduce, or die depending on the availability of food and the number of predators they have in the ecosystem.</p>
            <p>Players are rewarded experience points every time a new organism is added to the environment and through other means such as playing for a long period of time. Accumulating enough experience points will increase your level, which can unlock new species from the Shop for the player to purchase.</p>
            <p>As the ecosystem becomes more complex and sustainable, your overall score increases. That score called the Environment Score will be used to compare against other players to see who comes out on top that has the best ecosystem.</p>
        </div>
        <br />
        <div class="container_brown">
            <p>Before you can do any of this, you will have to got through the login process. The login process is very similar to other online applications that you may have encountered.</p>
        </div>
        <br />
        <img src="screen_shots/image_05.jpg" alt="" class="screen_shot"/>
        <div class="container_brown">
            <p>World of Balance requires every player to create an account before playing. If you do not have an account, creating one is actually quite simple by clicking on the Register button and fill in a short form afterwards.</p>
        </div>
        <br />
        <img src="screen_shots/image_10.jpg" alt="" class="screen_shot"/>
        <div class="container_brown">
            <p>This is the registration screen once you have clicked the Register button. As shown in the above image, it will ask for a username, password, and e-mail. Usernames are unique so make sure you come up with one that isn't used by another player.</p>
            <i><p>Note: In the current version, a Character Name is required to be entered, but serves no purpose.</p></i>
        </div>
        <br />
        <div class="container_brown">
            <p>Once you have your account created, it will bring you back to the login screen. In order to play, you will have to enter your username and password in the corresponding input boxes.</p>
        </div>
        <br />
        <img src="screen_shots/image_06.jpg" alt="" class="screen_shot"/>
        <div class="container_brown">
            <p>As soon as you are logged in, you will be presented with something called World Selection. You will be able to see your avatar information such as your current level and the amount of gold you have.</p>
            <p>The next group of information you see is information about worlds. You can manage all your worlds by using the combination of the drop-down menu and the buttons to the right of it. A world is essentially a lobby or room you must create that holds players and environments.</p>
        </div>
        <br />
        <div class="container_brown">
            <p>To create a world, just click on the Create button. It should only take a few seconds. Once it's created, it will show up in the drop-down menu.</p>
        </div>
        <br />
        <div class="container_brown">
            <p>You will now have to join this world by clicking on the Join button. The first time you join a world, it will take up to a minute or so to create the environment and the initial group of species.</p>
        </div>
        <br />
        <div class="container_brown">
            <p>In case you would like to start over, you could just create another world without having to delete your old one. If you simply don't want your existing world anymore, just select it in the drop-down menu and press the Delete button.</p>
        </div>
        <br />
        <img src="screen_shots/image_01.jpg" alt="" class="screen_shot"/>
        <div class="container_brown">
            <p>Once you have entered the world, you will be presented with an environment that looks like the one shown above. Utilizing the species available for purchase, your goal is to figure out what is the right combination of species, by referring to each species' preys and predators, to create a sustainable ecosystem.</p>
